# BusRaider by Rob Dobson

## Memory Mapped Graphics and Single-Step Debugging for Retro Computer

BusRaider is an add-on circuit board for the RC2014 retro computer.
It uses a Raspberry Pi Zero and an ESP32 to snoop on the bus of a 
host vintage 8 bit CPU and provide things like a memory mapped display,
WiFi connection, keyboard and single-step debugging
