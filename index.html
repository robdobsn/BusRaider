    <h1>Flash BusRaider ESP32 Module with Firmware</h1>
    <p>The ESP32 module on BusRaider can be flashed with the latest firmware from this page as long as you are running a recent version of Chrome or Edge browser.</p>
    <p>Please ensure that a micro-USB cable is connected from your computer to the connector on the ESP32 module and then press the button below.</p>
    <p>If you have more than one USB serial port connected then select the one that the ESP32 module is connected to. One way to tell is to try again after removing the USB cable and see what port is missing - then repeat and use that port.</p>
